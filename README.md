# HTML Widget for Neos CMS

Administrators and everyone with the privilegde `CodeQ.HtmlWidget:WidgetDefinition` can create HTML Widget Definitions, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We recommend to create a separate, hidden Widget Definiton page for that.

All editors can add those HTML Widgets as content.

## Features

*   Automatically blocks JavaScript code in the backend
*   Restricts editing of HTML widget definitions, while allowing editors to use those widgets
